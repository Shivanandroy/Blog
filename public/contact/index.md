# ðŸ‘‹ Hey There!

My name is **Shivanand Roy**.

I am a huge gear head and spent 4 years to pursue mechanical engineering, but few years ago a serendipitous event inspired me to get into Artificial Intelligence, and I love it. There is nothing greater than solving a business problem through data and predict awesome things, and it's a fantastic process that I feel lucky to participate in.

Outside of the office, I am committed to education and love to watch PyData, PyCon and Enthought videos. When I'm not working, I am usually at gym or at swimming pool. I am very much a kid at heart, love to cook, watch cricket, play video games, and travel whenever I can.

I love meeting new people and learning new things, so please feel to get in touch.
