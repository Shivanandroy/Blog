    <description><![CDATA[AbstractThis article will let you build a faster and accurate COVID Search Engine using TransformersðŸ¤—   Introduction In this article, we will build a search engine, which will not only retrieve and rank the articles based on the query but also give us the response, along with a 1000 words context around the response.
To achieve this, we will need:
 a structured dataset with reserach papers and its full text.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[AbstractIn this article, you will learn how to train a T5 model for text generation - to generate title given a research paper&rsquo;s abstract or summary using TransformersðŸ¤— Introduction T5 model is a Sequence-to-Sequence model. A Sequence-to-Sequence model is fully capable to perform any text to text conversion task. What does it mean? - It means that a T5 model can take any input text and convert it into any output text.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[AbstractIn this article, you will learn how to fetch contextual answers in a huge corpus of documents using TransformersðŸ¤—   Introduction We will build a neural question and answering system using transformers models (RoBERTa). This approach is capable to perform Q&amp;A across millions of documents in few seconds.
Data For this tutorial, I will use ArXiV&rsquo;s research papers abstracts to do Q&amp;A. The data is on Kaggle.]]></description>
