    <description><![CDATA[In this article, we will see how to fine tune a XLNet model on custom data, for text classification using Transformers🤗. XLNet is powerful! It beats BERT and its other variants in 20 different tasks. In simple words - XLNet is a generalized autoregressive model.
An Autoregressive model is a model which uses the context word to predict the next word. So, the next token is dependent on all previous tokens.
XLNET is generalized because it captures bi-directional context by means of a mechanism called permutation language modeling.
It integrates the idea of auto-regressive models and bi-directional context modeling, yet overcoming the disadvantages of BERT and thus outperforming BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin in tasks such as question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.

In this article, we will take a pretrained `XLNet` model and fine tune it on our dataset.]]></description>
